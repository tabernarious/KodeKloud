# KUBERNETES

# Kubernetes uses Docker Hosts, but also supports rkt and CRI-O (other container services)

# Node (Minion): Virtual or hardware machine where containers are launched
# Cluster: Set of nodes grouped together
# Master: Watches over nodes and is responsible for orchestrating containers on the worker nodes.

# Componenents:
Master
-API Server (frontend)
-etcd (key-value store, distributed across the cluster (masters?))
-Controller (brain behind orchestration; noticing when nodes go up/down
-Scheduler (distributing work/containers across multiple nodes)
-kubectl (Kubernetes CLI; used to manage the cluster)

Nodes
-kubelet (agent that runs on each node in the cluster; ensures containers are running as expected)
-Container Runtime (Docker)

# Deploy app on cluster
